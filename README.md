# GET STARTED

## Prerequisites

- This repository was implemented with python 3.8.5
- Before running the main function, run the following command to get all necessary additional libraries (to avoid libs conflicts, you may want to setup a virtualenv to run the code) : 

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How it works

- In the root of the repository, create a `config_api.ini` file (based on the `config_template.ini` one) : you have to add the JWT token and the API endpoint.
- You can change the other config default values if it suits you (`default_start_date` / `default_path`)
- Place yourself in the `data_updater` repository
- Run the following command (or `python entrypoint.py` according to your env) to generate a csv file with all the data available on the endpoint : 
```bash
$ python3 entrypoint.py
```
- If you re-run the same command, it will not append any data to the file.
- If you delete the final rows of the csv file and re-run the command, it will only append the rows you deleted (or the new transactions added to the endpoint)
- You can also run the following command if you want to override the default file path : 
```bash
$ python3 entrypoint.py --path my_personal_filename.csv
```

## Next steps

- Add unit tests (with pytest and requests-mock for example)
- Add a docker and Airflow setup to schedule the refresh of the data

# ABOUT THE TEST
- The history is not available directly in the github repo, but can be generated by following the steps above
- There are 2867 completed transactions from EUR to BTC in the available data
